        "In this project, we have analyzed the Financial Statement Data Set created by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our focus is on understanding corporate relationships and financial health using advanced data analysis tools. We have used Neo4j for graph-based data representation, enabling us to uncover complex relationships among companies and executives. Additionally, we have utilized Python libraries such as matplotlib and yfiles_jupyter_graphs_for_neo4j to visualize key financial metrics and extract meaningful insights. This has helped us better understand the intricate financial networks that exist between companies."
